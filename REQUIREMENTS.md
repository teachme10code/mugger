Requirements
Version Control: Use Git and Github from the beginning and commit frequently.
Design
Your app must implement the sketches and user story provided above.
You can design your own logo, or use the one from the provided sketch if you prefer (available for download here).
You are free to embellish the UI. In the sketches we've kept the styling to a minimum. Feel free to "prettify" your app.
Behaviors
Form validates that user supplied text input
When a user clicks submit, the text field in the form is cleared and text appears that indicates Instagram is being queried.
The app should query the Instagram API and search for recent pictures tagged with the term the user has supplied in the form.
When the API results return, the app should tell the user how many results were returned, and display the photos (if any).
You should be able to navigate to the original photo on Instagram by clicking on any one of the images that appear.
Your app must use at least one animation. It's up to you to decide where to put this.
In case your calls to the server fail for some reason, the app should somehow alert the user.
Users should be able to submit another search after one has completed.
Project completion When you've completed, share your work:
Share a link to a live page (via Github Pages, CodePen, or equivalent) to your app. Share it with both your mentor and your community.
Share a link to your Github code repo with your mentor. Be ready for code review at your next mentor meeting.
